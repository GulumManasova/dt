    "# Linear Regression\n",
    "Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables (predictors) and a dependent variable (outcome). It assumes that the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear, meaning that changes in the independent variables are associated with constant changes in the dependent variable."
